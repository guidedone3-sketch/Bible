<b>Thank you for visiting my website.Here's your bible verse for today and its exegesis so you may reflect</b>

<br/><br/>

<p>“This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead.”(Ecclesiastes 9:3)

Scholarly Exegesis(from other site):
<br/>
</b>

For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by all that is before them. All things come alike to all: there is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean, and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that sweareth, as he that feareth an oath. This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart while they live, and after that they go to the dead. For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for a living dog is better than a dead lion. For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory of them is forgotten. Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.

My understanding:

<br/>
</b>

Misguidance and unethicality are understood to be widespread and mankind has a natural tendency to submit to the negative energy/the devil's influence at such great speeds that often it can be interpreted as madness.In short, being truly ethical is a lifelong struggle because of our 'almost' natural tendency to do the unethical. So we have to be always on guard even after baptism and accepting Jesus, we have to follow his legacy to the max and to do that we have to always stay vigilant of our own limitations and inabilities most often to resist the negative energy/satan's temptations.

Peace be upon you
Amen
